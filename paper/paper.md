# Summary

`LinRegOutliers` is a Julia package that implements a number of outlier detection algorithms for linear regression. The package also implements robust covariance matrix estimation and graphing functions which can be used to visualize the regression residuals and distances between observations, with many possible metrics (*e.g.*, the Euclidean or Mahalanobis distances with either given or estimated covariance matrices). Our package covers a significant portion of the literature on fitting with outliers and allows users to quickly try many different methods with reasonable default settings, while also providing a good starting framework for researchers who may want to extend the package with novel methods.


# State of the field
In linear regression, we are given a number of data points (say, $n$) represented by vectors $x_i$ with $p$ entries, and observations (also called dependent variables) that correspond to each of these data points, which are represented by scalars $y_i$, for $i=1, \dots, n$. We then seek to find the linear model which best describes the data (up to some error term, $\epsilon_i$):
$$
y_i = x_i^T\beta + \epsilon_i,
$$
for $i=1, \dots, n$, where $\beta$ is the vector of unknown parameters, with $p$ entries. We will assume that $\epsilon_i$ are independent and identically-distributed (i.i.d.) error terms with zero mean.

We can write this more conveniently by letting $X$ be the *design matrix* of size $n\times p$, whose rows are given by the vectors $x_i$, while $y$ is an $n$-vector of observations, whose entries are $y_i$, and similarly for $\epsilon$:
$$
y = X\beta + \epsilon.
$$
The usual approach to finding an estimate for $\beta$, which we call $\hat \beta$, is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator given by $\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$, which works very well when the error terms are all of roughly the same magnitude (*i.e.*, there are no outliers). On the other hand, the OLS estimator is very sensitive to outliers: even if a single 
observation lies far from the regression hyperplane, OLS will often fail to find a good estimate for the parameters, $\beta$.

To solve this problem, a number of methods have been developed in the literature. These methods can be roughly placed in one or more of the four following categories: diagnostics, direct methods, robust methods, and multivariate methods. *Diagnostics* are methods which attempt to find points that significantly affect the fit of a model (often, such points can be labeled as outliers). Diagnostics can then be used to initialize *direct methods*, which fit a (usually non-robust) model to a subset of points suspected to be clear of outliers; remaining points which are not outliers with respect to this fit are continually added to this subset until all points not in the subset are deemed outliers. *Robust methods*, on the other hand, find a best-fit model by approximately minimizing a loss function that does not significantly penalize points with large residual.
Some of the proposed methods are also *multivariate methods*, which can accommodate fitting models that depend on more than one parameter.
    
# Statement of need 

In practice, many of the proposed methods have reasonable performance and yield similar results for most datasets, but sometimes differ widely in specific circumstances. Additionally, some of the methods are relatively complicated and, if canonical implementations are available, they are often out of date or only found in specific languages of the author's choice, making it difficult for researchers to compare the performance of these algorithms on their datasets. To solve this issue, we have reimplemented many of the algorithms available in the literature in Julia [@julia], an open-source, high performance programming language designed primarily for scientific computing. Our package, *LinRegOutliers*, is a comprehensive and simple-to-use Julia package that includes many of the algorithms avaietecting outliers in linear regression. The package implements
`hadimeasure` [@hadimeasure], `covratio`, `dfbeta`, `dffit` [@diagnostics], `cooks` [@cooks]  for regression diagnostics,
`ransac` [@ransac], `ks89` [@ks89], `hs93` [@hs93], `atkinson94` [@atkinson94],  `py95` [@py95], `cm97` [@cm97], `smr98` [@smr98], `asm2000` [@asm2000], `bacon` [@bacon],  `imon2005` [@imon2005], `bch` [@bch], `lad` [@lad], `lta` [@lta], 
`lms` [@lms], `lts` [@lts], `satman2013` [@satman2013], `satman2015` [@satman2015] for regression data, and `hadi1992` [@hadi1992], `hadi1994` [@hadi1994], `ccf` [@ccf], `mve` [@mve], `mcd` [@mcd], and `dataimage` [@dataimage] for multivariate data.


# Installation and basic usage

*LinRegOutliers* can be downloaded and installed using the Julia package manager by typing

```julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("LinRegOutliers")
```

in the Julia console. The regression methods follow a uniform call convention. For instance, a user can type

```julia
julia> smr98(@formula(calls ~ year), phones)
```

or

```julia
julia> X = hcat(ones(24), phones[:, "year"]);
julia> y = phones[:, "calls"];
julia> smr98(X, y)
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24

```

to apply *smr98* [@smr98] on the Telephone dataset [@lms], where $X$ is the design matrix with ones in its first column. In this case, observations 15 to 24 are reported as outliers by the method. Some methods may also return additional information specific to the method which is passed back in a ```Dict``` object. For example, the *ccf* function returns a ```Dict``` object containing *betas*, *outliers*, *lambdas*, and *residuals*:

```julia
julia> ccf(X, y)
Dict{Any,Any} with 4 entries:
  "betas"     => [-63.4816, 1.30406]
  "outliers"  => [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
  "lambdas"   => [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ...
  "residuals" => [-2.67878, -1.67473, -0.37067, -0.266613, â€¦
```

Indices of outliers can be accessed using standard ```Dict``` operations like

```julia
julia> result = ccf(X, y)
julia> result["outliers"]
```
